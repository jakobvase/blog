# Mail server

[Previous](./hosting-problems.md)

I want to have a mail server for emails on my domain.
This is easy to set up with [shared web hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service),
but since I don't want to lock myself into PHP or C#, I want to go another route.

After some looking, I discover this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/avf4tl/container_for_email_server/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
Several apparently very experienced people discussing how they hate to manage a mail server and never want to do it again.
Oh well.
I guess that means I'll look into getting some big mail client to handle mails to my domain.
Luckily, I don't know anything about that either!
